### Usage
When launched, vboard presents a compact keyboard with a minimal interface. The keyboard includes:
- Standard QWERTY layout keys
- Arrow keys
- Modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Super)

#### Interface Controls
- â˜° (menu) - Toggle visibility of other interface controls
- **Background dropdown** - Change the keyboard background color
- + - Increase opacity
- - - Decrease opacity
- US/UA/RU - Change locale to write on diferent language


### Configuration
vboard saves its settings to ~/.config/vboard/settings.conf. This configuration file stores:
- Background color
- Opacity level
- Text color
You can manually edit this file or use the built-in interface controls to customize the appearance.

### Customizing Keyboard Layout
The keyboard layout is defined in the rows list in the source code. To modify the layout:
1. Download the source code
2. Locate the rows definition (around line 175) search line with `#locales` `#rows depended on locale` if I did it you would to
3. Modify the key arrangement as needed
4. The format follows a nested list structure where each inner list represents a row of keys

## Troubleshooting
### 1. Error: 'no such device'
 Make sure uinput kernel module is loded with
```bash
sudo modprobe uinput
```

to make sure it auto load on boot create file with
```bash
echo 'uinput' | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/module-uinput.conf
```

### 2. Error: 'Permission Denied'
Reload udev rules with
```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```
